      "[\"A safe haven in the middle of the metropolis: We took a traditional brick building with roots dating back to the 1800s and set a new standard for hostel life in the UK.\\nWhat was once sailors' accommodation is now a hostel that caters for all the needs of the modern traveller. With great attention to detail, we have created a hostel in London that celebrates the heritage of our historic building.\\nThe old oak that once formed part of sturdy ships and churches is now immortalised in our furnishings throughout the house. The beers you drink here will be served on a bar made from 500 year old wood!\\n\\nOur Wombat's City Hostel is located in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, right next to the famous Tower Bridge and Tower of London, charming markets, authentic pubs and many other places of historical interest.\\nA short walk will take you to trendy Shoreditch with its vibrant street art, the lively nightlife of Hoxton Square and Old Street and finally Brick Lane, which has become one of the most popular spots.\\nAll other London attractions are easily accessible by public transport: Aldgate East and Tower Bridge underground and DLR stations are just a stone's throw away. \\n\\nAfter a long and exciting day in London, our hostel awaits you with a cosy courtyard, a spacious lobby with our own Wombat's Cafe (exclusive Wombat's Roast included) and womBAR.
